# SONAR Rock and Mine Prediction Using Machine Learning

This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at classifying SONAR signals as either rock or mine (metal cylinder). The dataset used for this project is the SONAR dataset, which consists of 208 instances with 60 features each.

## Introduction
The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model capable of accurately classifying SONAR signals as either rocks or mines. Such a classification has practical applications in underwater exploration and resource identification.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the SONAR dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains 208 instances with 60 numerical features representing the energy of signals across different frequency bands.

- **Classes:** Rock, Mine
- **Instances:** 208
- **Features:** 60

## Installation
To run the code in this repository, ensure that Python is installed along with the necessary libraries. You can install the required dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Requirements
The `requirements.txt` file includes the following dependencies:

```
numpy
pandas
scikit-learn
matplotlib
seaborn
```

## Usage
Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SONAR-Rock-and-Mine-ML.git
cd SONAR-Rock-and-Mine-ML
```

### Running the Code
You can use either Google Colab or VS Code to execute the scripts.

#### Using Google Colab:
- Upload the notebook (`sonar_classification.ipynb`) to Google Colab.
- Run the cells to train and evaluate the models.

#### Using Python Script:
If you prefer running a Python script, execute the following command:

```bash
python sonar_classification.py
```

## Machine Learning Models
The following machine learning algorithms have been implemented and evaluated in this project:

- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Naive Bayes

## Results
Each model is evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The results provide insights into the most effective model for SONAR signal classification.
